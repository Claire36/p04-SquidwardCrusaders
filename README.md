## Description of website/app
We will be finding the relationship between traffic congestion and the concentration of 4 air pollutants (O3, CO, SO2, and NO2) by comparing data from 2 datasets. Users will be able to pick an air pollutant upon logging in. Then, they will see maps of its concentration for each year from 2000 to 2011 alongside maps of traffic congestion over that same time period to see how changes in congestion affect the concentration of the air pollutant that they chose.
